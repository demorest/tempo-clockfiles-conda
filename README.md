# tempo-clockfiles-conda

This creates a conda pacakge containing clock files for both tempo and
tempo2.  This package was split off from the main tempo/tempo2 packages
so that it can be more frequently updated without reinstalling all the
code.  The observatory clock files are obtained from the tempo/tempo2
source repositories.  Updated UT1 data is downloaded from IERS.
